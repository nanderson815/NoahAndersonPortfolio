            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
                Noah is an Atlanta native, and has lived in the city – or its suburbs – almost his entire life. After
                graduating from
                Blessed Trinity High School in Roswell, Noah attended the University of Georgia in Athens. Noah
                graduated Magna Cum
                Laude with a dual major in Finance and International Business.</p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
                After graduation, Noah moved to Raleigh, North Carolina to work as an analyst for PNC Bank. He worked
                in the Treasury
                Management group within Corporate and Institutional Banking, where he focused on delivering financial
                technology
                products to businesses in order to optimize operational efficiencies.
            </p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
                Noah currently works as an Associate Relationship Manager within Commercial Banking in Midtown,
                Atlanta. As an
                Associate, Noah is tasked with being an advisor to the businesses he works with. He provides industry
                trends and
                insights, access to capital, and a variety of products spanning from Treasury Management to Capital
                Markets. Noah’s
                goal is to ensure the businesses he works with have all the tools and resources they need to succeed.
            </p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
                When he’s not at work, Noah is usually trying a new restaurant, playing golf, watching UGA football, or
                working on his
                website (GeorgiaonmyDime.com). Noah is passionate about finance and technology, and is currently
                attending the Georgia
                Institute of Technology Coding Bootcamp with the goal of creating a career that encompasses both
                passions.
